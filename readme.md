An original defuse (de_) map created between December, 2004 and May, 2005 for Counter-Strike 1.6 & Counter-Strike: Condition Zero.

All the custom textures, which were made by Blazeeer! (credits to him) are bundled in the .bsp file. This map makes use of the detailed textures feature, and the .tga and _detail.txt files are provided in the gfx/detail and maps folders.

I was not able to recover the original .rmf file for this map, so here I'm only providing the compiled version.

## What is each file?

.nav - It's the file that bots used to know how to navigate through a map. It is required for the 1.6 bots to avoid them behaving awkwardly.

.res - Lists the resources required by the game to be able to download all the map dependencies when downloading the map from a server when you don't have it in your computer.

.bsp - Compiled map. Ready to run in CS 1.6

.rmf - Source of the map. Can be opened with Valve Hammer Editor 3.5. It requires importing the Half-Life 1.1.1.0 textures (halflife.wad) and de_dust2 textures (de_dust2.wad)

.txt - Info file.
